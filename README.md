# RTKBackup/Robot Sprinkler
This is used in Senior Design Project for GPS movement

# Overview
This library allows us to receive GPS data from satellites and translate it into readable data so we can send that information
to the robot. The robot will use that information to travel to the next point and water the area. This is the base station 
that will send coordinates to the rover to travel to.
